        "1. From the abstract, this paper seems to be about data cleaning, especially the theoretical side of this process. The concept of cleanliness is being refered to as \"Tidyness\" and the author mentions the creation of tools for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The purpose of the tidy data standard is to be a standard process for data cleaning. The author bases its principles from their own experience in the field and does so in a way to help with analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For the first sentence, messy datasets haven't been standardized and therefore have their own unique randomness. This is opposite to tidy data, which behaves similarly since it has been structured to be similar. The second sentence references how defining data might be obvious to the creator but not so much to others that may read it. Therefore, it is important to define things when possible, and also to not always assume the obvious.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Values are quantitative things like numbers or qualatative things like strings. Variables contain values which measure attributes (height, temperature, time, etc.). Observations are all values measured in the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Tidy data is when each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. There are five common problems with messy datasets: column headers are values, multiple values are in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units in one table, and a single observational unit is stored within multiple tables. The issue with Table 4 is that income is used but the heading should be a title and not the numbers themselves. Melting, or stacking, is turning columns into rows. \n",
        "\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because it has days (d1 ... dn) at the top, but these are values and shouldn't each have separate columns. Table 12 is molten because these days are stacked into the data variable, but the element variable has both tmax and tmin when these should be separated.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Data cleaning is important but should be studyed more in depth. Wickham hopes that this leads to more set/standardized principles in the field for data cleaning, which will be useful to everyone."
